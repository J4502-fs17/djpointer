<p>About Me</p>
</div>
<p>
   My name is originally Deja but I've been giving the name DJ because
  of my energetic personality and strong interest in music.My first and
   middle initials also spell out D.J. The next thing to note is I love
    to explore different  cultures and music. My YouTube Channel is all
    about me listening to different music from Korean,Hindu, and Indian music
    industries and seeing if I like the music that is the topic for that week.
<p>  I'm a senior at the school of journalism studying

    multimedia producing. I'm very passionate about hip hop
    music and culture and I love to report on things happening
    in the music industry. I want to use digital platforms to
    engage people to talk about music!</p>
<p>I am a senior at the Missouri School of Journalism where I study
   multimedia producing.  I have always had a passion for everything music and
    pop culture related.During my college career, I was given the name DJ by
     my peers and professors because of my energetic spirit and awareness  of
     music and the culture that it embodies. I soon discovered a love for video
     and digital storytelling. I would love to create a bigger outlet for people
  to engage with content using multiple media platforms. I want to do this by
  creating new ideas for audience engagement and digital storytelling.</p>

  <p> Here's one of my favorite jokes! What does food surf on?</p>
